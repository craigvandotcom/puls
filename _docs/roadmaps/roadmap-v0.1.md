# MVP Roadmap: Health Tracker PWA (v0.1)

This document outlines the development roadmap for the MVP (v0.1) of the Health Tracker application - a Progressive Web App (PWA) with a local-first architecture focused on core health tracking functionality.

## MVP Scope (v0.1)

The MVP focuses on delivering a fully functional, offline-capable PWA with robust local data storage and essential health tracking features. This version provides the foundation for user validation and feedback collection.

### Core MVP Features:

- **Local-First Architecture**: Complete offline functionality with IndexedDB storage
- **Health Data Tracking**: Food, liquid, stool, and symptom logging
- **Camera Integration**: Photo capture for food logging
- **Data Visualization**: Core charts and progress indicators
- **Data Ownership**: Export/import functionality for user data control
- **PWA Compliance**: Installable, offline-capable application

## Engineering Principles

**Solo Developer Focus:** This roadmap is optimized for a single developer, prioritizing:

- **Simplicity over complexity** - Avoid over-engineering
- **Reactive state management** - Use `useLiveQuery` to eliminate manual state synchronization
- **Clean architecture** - Separate data layer from UI components
- **Security by design** - Implement proper API security from the start
- **Privacy preservation** - Maintain the ephemeral processing model throughout

- [x] setup bug bot

**Goal:** Implement a two-step, privacy-preserving AI analysis flow to provide intelligent food logging, with a human-in-the-loop validation step to ensure accuracy.

- [x] **Task 11: Set Up OpenRouter AI Infrastructure (`setup-openrouter`)**
  - **Action:** Establish a unified, cost-effective AI gateway using **OpenRouter** to access multiple large language models (LLMs) through a single API key.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Create an OpenRouter account and purchase initial credits (free-tier is acceptable for development).
    - Store the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in `.env.local` (and `.env.example`) and expose it to Vercel for production builds.
    - Add a thin `lib/ai/openrouter.ts` helper that wraps the OpenRouter-compatible `OpenAI` client and sets `baseURL = "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"`.
    - Document routing shortcuts (`:floor` for cheapest, `:nitro` for fastest) and the free-model policy in `README`.
    - Implement a simple health-check endpoint (`/api/ai-status`) that pings OpenRouter and returns model availability so we can surface downtime gracefully in the UI.
  - **Outcome:** A single, flexible entry point for all AI calls, allowing us to experiment with GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini Flash, etc., without changing code paths.

- [x] **Task 12: Implement Vision-Based Ingredient Identification (`implement-vision-identification`)**
  - **Action:** Build the first stage of the AI pipeline. The user captures a photo, and a vision model identifies potential ingredients.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Create a secure API route (`/api/analyze-image`) that accepts an image.
    - This route calls a multimodal vision model (e.g., GPT-4o) with a prompt to extract a list of ingredient names from the image.
    - The API route will return a simple JSON array of ingredient strings.
    - Implement loading and error states on the client-side for this process.
  - **Outcome:** A functional "scan-to-text" feature where a food photo is converted into a preliminary list of ingredients.

- [x] **Task 13: Integrate Vision Analysis with Food Dialog (`integrate-vision-with-dialog`)**
  - **Action:** Connect the camera capture flow to the ingredient identification API and populate the `AddFoodDialog` for user review.
  - **Implementation:**
    - After the user captures a photo, call the `/api/analyze-image` endpoint.
    - Take the returned list of ingredient strings and use it to pre-populate the ingredient list within the `AddFoodDialog`.
    - The UI must clearly indicate that these are AI suggestions, and the user has full control to add, edit, or remove ingredients before submission. This fulfills the "human-in-the-loop" requirement.
  - **Outcome:** A seamless user flow from photo capture to an editable list of AI-suggested ingredients, ready for user validation.

- [x] **Task 14: Implement AI-Powered Ingredient Zoning (`implement-ai-zoning`)**
  - **Action:** Build the second stage of the AI pipeline. Once the user confirms the ingredient list, send it to another AI for classification based on the Body Compass zoning rules.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Create a second secure API route (`/api/zone-ingredients`) that accepts a JSON array of ingredient strings.
    - This route calls a powerful language model with a detailed system prompt containing the "Instructions for Food & Ingredient Zoning".
    - The AI will return a structured JSON object for each ingredient, including its assigned `zone` and `foodGroup`.
    - Implement robust Zod validation on the API response to ensure data integrity before saving to the database.
  - **Outcome:** An intelligent zoning engine that can classify any list of ingredients according to the project's specific nutritional philosophy.

- [x] make sure that rate limiting is also configured for image analysis calls
- [x] add time edit to entry edit page
- [x] change capture photo screen to look like dribble FULL screen concept
- [x] add upload photo option alongside capture
- [x] in manual entry page: show image of food too

- [x] **Task 15: Finalize AI Data Flow and UI (`finalize-ai-flow`)**
  - **Action:** Connect the full AI pipeline to the database and update the UI to handle the final, enriched data.
  - **Implementation:**
    - When the user submits the `AddFoodDialog`, the confirmed ingredient list is sent to the `/api/zone-ingredients` endpoint.
    - A loading state will be shown while the ingredients are being zoned.
    - Upon receiving the zoned ingredients, the complete `Food` object is assembled on the client and saved to IndexedDB using the existing data layer functions.
    - Ensure all statuses (`analyzing`, `processed`) are correctly managed in the UI and the database.
  - **Outcome:** A complete, end-to-end AI-powered food logging experience, from photo capture to storing fully analyzed and zoned ingredient data.

#### **2. Implement the Simplified API Route**

**File:** `app/api/zone-ingredients/route.ts`

**Action:** This API route will be straightforward. It receives a list of ingredients, sends them all to the AI with the rubric, and returns the result.

**Engineer's Checklist:**

1.  **Receive Request:** Get the `ingredients` array from the request body.
2.  **Validate Input:** Use a Zod schema to ensure the request body is an object with an `ingredients` key that is an array of strings.
3.  **Construct Prompt:** Create the full prompt string to send to the AI, combining the static rubric from `prompts.ingredientZoning` with the dynamic list of ingredients from the user.
4.  **Call AI:** Make a single API call to OpenRouter with the complete prompt. Ensure the `response_format` is set to `json_object`.
5.  **Validate AI Response:** When the response comes back, parse the JSON and validate its structure using another Zod schema. This is critical to prevent malformed data from crashing the app.
6.  **Return Response:** If validation passes, return the zoned ingredients to the client. If anything fails, return a structured error.

#### **3. Implement Security: Rate Limiting**

**File:** `app/api/zone-ingredients/route.ts`

**Action:** Before any logic runs, implement IP-based rate limiting to prevent abuse of this potentially expensive endpoint.

**Engineer's Checklist:**

1.  **Integrate Upstash:** Use the `@upstash/ratelimit` package.
2.  **Set Limit:** Configure a reasonable limit (e.g., 20 requests per minute) for the MVP.
3.  **Return Error:** If the rate limit is exceeded, immediately return a `429 Too Many Requests` error.

#### **4. Finalize Client-Side Integration**

**File:** `features/foods/components/food-entry-form.tsx`

**Action:** The existing client-side logic is already well-suited for this simplified flow.

**Engineer's Checklist:**

1.  **Verify API Call:** In the `handleSubmit` function, ensure the `fetch` call to `/api/zone-ingredients` correctly sends the `ingredients` array in the request body.
2.  **Handle States:** Maintain the existing loading and error states. When the user submits, the UI should show a "Zoning ingredients..." message.
3.  **Process Data:** The existing logic that maps the API response back to the ingredients list before saving to the database is correct and should be kept.

This plan delivers a functional, secure, and testable AI zoning feature for the MVP, giving you maximum exposure to the AI's performance so you can refine the rubric and prompts effectively.
